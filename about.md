# SIGMA Recon – Intelligence Methodology

---


## Purpose & Scope


SIGMA Recon is designed to deliver **high-integrity, modular intelligence** products across six strategic regions: Russia, Ukraine, China, Iran, Israel, and North Korea. This methodology outlines the **analytical tradecraft**, **source handling**, **forecasting techniques**, and **formatting standards** used to produce ECHO Watch briefs, SIGMA Strategic Reports, and ARES Dossiers.

## Core Principles


- **BLUF Priority** (Bottom Line Up Front)  
- **Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs)**  
- **Superforecasting Discipline**  
- **Clarity > Complexity**  
- **Intelligence First, Interface Second**


---


## Analytical Tradecraft


We apply tools from U.S. and allied intelligence communities, including:


- **CIA Tradecraft Primer (2009)**  
- **Psychology of Intelligence Analysis** (Heuer)  
- **Grey Dynamics SAT Framework**  
- **DIA & Belfer Center Guidelines**


**Techniques Used:**


- Key Assumptions Check  
- Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)  
- Devil’s Advocacy & Red Teaming  
- Alternative Futures & Indicators  
- Outside-In Thinking


All SIGMA analysts are trained to apply these techniques systematically across briefs.


---


## Forecasting Approach


We integrate models from **Superforecasting** (Tetlock):


- Probabilistic Forecasting (0–100%)  
- Calibration & Brier Scoring  
- Confidence Intervals  
- Signal Identification & Scenario Trees  
- Updating Forecasts with New Intel


Each ECHO Watch may include a **7-day regional forecast** and soon, rolling **24-hour predictive updates**.


---


## Source Handling


- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** only  
- Sources are evaluated for:  
  - Credibility  
  - Bias  
  - Redundancy  
  - Timeliness  
- Each brief contains a **Source Index** for traceability


---


## Cognitive Bias Mitigation


SIGMA analysts are trained to detect and reduce:


- Confirmation bias  
- Anchoring  
- Satisficing  
- Mirror imaging  
- Availability bias  


Biases are mitigated through structured techniques and peer review cycles.

## Output Formats


SIGMA products are standardized across three key output types:


### 1. ECHO Watch
- Daily tactical brief  
- BLUF format  
- Forecast section  
- Analyst Note  
- Markdown export for Obsidian


### 2. SIGMA Brief
- Weekly strategic assessment  
- WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/WHY structure  
- ARES Dossier highlights  
- Market + Geo-economic section  
- Visuals and source appendix


### 3. ARES Dossiers
- Structured actor profiles (Capability, Intent, Posture, Behavior)  
- Threat modeling and behavioral forecast


---


## Tools & Stack


- Markdown-first formatting (Obsidian-compatible)  
- GitHub/Jekyll for web publishing (under development)  
- LLM-Augmented Drafting (GPT-4o with SIGMA custom layer)  
- Human verification remains standard


---


## Credibility and Review


- All intelligence products are reviewed by a second analyst  
- Forecasts are updated based on unfolding indicators  
- Transparency and auditability are prioritized
