# ECHO Watch – 23 June 2025  
**Classification:** Unclassified  
**Analyst:** SIGMA Watch Group

## Executive Summary:

The atmosphere of global threats is still very unstable. In response to allied attacks on nuclear infrastructure, Iran gets ready for asymmetric retaliation. Russia expands its psychological warfare by stepping up missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. Beijing uses military exercises and penalties to intensify its pressure campaign against Taiwan. North Korea signals conformity with a broader anti-Western stance by resuming nuclear and ballistic missile testing.

**Scope & Objectives:**

This daily brief provides an OSINT-driven update on key threat regions including Iran, Israel, Russia, Ukraine, China, Taiwan, and North Korea, focusing on attacks, significant geopolitical shifts, and military activities within the last 24-48 hours.

**Methodology:**

Information is compiled from open-source intelligence leveraging structured analytic techniques (SATs), principles from cognitive science in intelligence analysis, and superforecasting methodologies to provide a clear, concise, and actionable overview.

> **Disclaimer:** This report is based entirely on publicly available sources. It reflects the author’s analytical judgment and does not represent official views of any government or institution. All assessments are subject to revision as new information emerges.

## Major Threat Updates + Assessments

### Iran–Israel Conflict

- **IAEA Warning:** Rafael Grossi warns the UN of catastrophic fallout if the Bushehr nuclear facility is attacked.  
- **UK Withdrawal:** British staff leave Tehran amid heightened risk.  
- **Cyber Retaliation:** Iranian hacktivist groups claim cyber attacks on Israeli systems.

**Assessment:**  
Iran is adjusting its reaction on the diplomatic, proxy, and cyber fronts. Although it is less likely in the short term, direct state retaliation is still possible. Concern of nuclear escalation has increased globally, according to the IAEA statement. Within 48 to 72 hours, anticipate cyber reprisal and possible proxy attacks, particularly from Iraqi militias or Hezbollah.

---

### Russia–Ukraine War

- **Urban Bombardment:** Russia launches mass missile strikes on Kyiv and Kharkiv.  
- **Ukrainian Naval Strike:** Ukraine hits Russian Black Sea Fleet asset via drone.  
- **NATO Posture:** NATO boosts air policing; Russia blames it for aiding Ukrainian operations.

**Assessment:**  
Moscow is intensifying its campaign of urban warfare in an effort to undermine infrastructure and lower morale. Ukraine's growing asymmetric reach is reflected in the naval strike. The existence of NATO raises the possibility of error in judgment. Over the next 72 hours, there will probably be more escalation, especially in southern marine zones and air defense saturation.

---

### China–Taiwan Tensions

- **US Navy Transit:** A destroyer transits the Taiwan Strait; China protests.  
- **Sanctions:** Beijing sanctions U.S. defense contractors over arms sales.  
- **Emergency Measures:** Taiwan activates emergency centers.

**Assessment:**  
China is using economic and symbolic punishment to strengthen its redlines. Though scheduled as part of regular FONOPS, the US transit serves as a reminder to Beijing of the naval presence. Taiwan is prepared for a quick escalation based on its internal posture. Over the next week, cyber operations from organizations with ties to the PRC continue to pose a threat.

---

### North Korea

- **Missile Launch:** Intermediate-range missile test-fired into the Sea of Japan.  
- **Nuclear Activity:** Yongbyon facility shows renewed activity via satellite.  
- **US Provocation Claims:** Pyongyang condemns B-52 deployment.

**Assessment:**  
In the midst of international tensions, North Korea's actions are consistent with larger anti-Western signals. The actions of Yongbyon point to a determination to maintain deterrence while applying diplomatic pressure to the US and allies. In the next 72 hours, there should be more missile launches or rhetorical provocations, most likely in conjunction with Japanese or American drills.

## Cross-Regional Connections

- **Axis Signaling – Iran, Russia, North Korea**  
  All four actors are escalating simultaneously across different domains (air, cyber, nuclear), possibly leveraging global distraction to test Western response thresholds. This suggests loose coordination or opportunistic convergence among adversaries.

- **Cyber Warfare Overlap**  
  Iranian hacktivist campaigns mirror North Korea’s past cyber strategies and Russia’s use of digital disruption. Expect increased cyber convergence, shared toolkits, and proxy overlap.

- **Strategic Diversion**  
  China and North Korea may be exploiting the Middle East crisis to shift attention from their regional actions. This mirrors past behavior during high-profile Western engagements elsewhere.

- **Airspace & ISR Saturation**  
  Concurrent U.S. surveillance, air policing, and naval activity across Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific may strain allied response time and increase risk of intelligence blind spots.

- **Proxy Utilization Patterns**  
  Iran and Russia both demonstrate reliance on proxies—militias and private military firms, respectively. These tools allow deniable escalation and regional reach, complicating attribution and response.

- **Sanctions and Economic Leverage**  
  China’s use of targeted sanctions on U.S. defense firms may influence broader deterrence postures. Other adversaries may adopt similar measures in parallel, creating a multi-vector economic front.

## Superforecasting Outlook (Next 72 Hours)

| Region         | Escalation Risk | Likely Catalyst                            | Forecast Period    |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Iran–Israel    | **High (85%)**    | Retaliatory drone/missile or cyber attacks  | 24–72 hours        |
| Russia–Ukraine | **High (75%)**    | Urban strikes and naval retaliation         | Continuous         |
| China–Taiwan   | **Moderate (60%)**| PLA activity in ADIZ or cyber campaigns     | 48–72 hours        |
| North Korea    | **Tense (50%)**   | New missile or Yongbyon reprocessing alert  | 72-hour window     |

## Key Assumptions

- **Iran** will prioritize indirect retaliation methods (cyber, proxy attacks) to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces while preserving escalation control. Supreme Leader guidance will likely constrain IRGC actions to avoid triggering overt war. Iran may seek deniability through third-party actors in Iraq, Syria, or Lebanon.

- **Israel** is expected to maintain a defensive posture unless attacked directly, using pre-emptive strikes only if actionable intelligence confirms imminent threats. Domestic political stability under pressure may incentivize demonstrable deterrence.

- **Russia** is unlikely to shift to full-scale strategic escalation unless Ukrainian or NATO operations penetrate deep Russian territory. Psychological warfare, urban terror, and energy disruption remain preferred tools.

- **Ukraine** will continue asymmetric strikes, particularly maritime and drone-based, focusing on eroding Russian logistics and projecting operational reach. Morale-boosting operations will take precedence ahead of any stalled peace process.

- **NATO** remains committed to deterrence without provocation. Air policing and ISR coverage will increase along the eastern flank. Red-line clarity remains a challenge with hybrid operations near or across alliance borders.

- **China** will escalate through *gray zone* measures (economic retaliation, cyber ops, information warfare) rather than kinetic conflict. Taiwan Strait military operations will continue to pressure the U.S. and Taipei without triggering direct confrontation. Internal political optics ahead of CPC Party Congress shape Beijing’s tempo.

- **Taiwan** will continue civil defense mobilization and messaging, avoiding escalation while reinforcing readiness. Public support for independence will be tempered by fear of escalation.

- **North Korea** is using the global distraction to conduct tests and reposition for future bargaining. Their nuclear rhetoric is part of a calibrated campaign to extract concessions or sow division between allies.

### About the Key Assumptions

The previous assumptions frame the analysis and forecasts presented in this brief. They reflect current intelligence, actor behavior patterns, strategic intent, and known capabilities. While not certainties, these assumptions shape the most plausible operational environment over the next 72 hours. They serve to clarify the analytic lens and support transparency in forecasting.
