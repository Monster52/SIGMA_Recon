### Analyst Summary

Regional tensions continue to spiral in the **Middle East**, with successive waves of Iranian drone and missile attacks testing Israeli defenses. Tehran appears to be pursuing a strategy of punitive escalation without provoking full-scale war, potentially to buy time for renewed nuclear diplomacy. Meanwhile, **Washington’s military and diplomatic posture is divided**, offering both deterrence and disunity.

In Asia, China’s carrier exercises assert regional naval strategy along contested island chains—reflecting a wider strategic posture. Simultaneously, energy markets signal susceptibility to systemic geopolitical shocks.
