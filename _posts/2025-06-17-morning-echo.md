#### **U.S. Naval Positioning**
- **What’s happening:** Dual carrier presence (Nimitz + Vinson), Aegis ships repositioned to Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea.
- **Strategic angle:** Deterrent posturing, missile shield support, and potential asset protection for Israel/U.S. bases.
- **Forecast:** 60% chance of additional U.S. naval escalation if conflict expands to include proxy strikes on Gulf shipping.

### Analyst Summary

We are seeing multi-theater escalation with maritime and cyber dimensions expanding. Iran’s asymmetric pressure is being mirrored by U.S. carrier deployments, while electronic warfare and disinformation campaigns complicate attribution. The Strait of Hormuz represents the highest-risk flashpoint—particularly if AIS interference leads to kinetic mishaps.

Global powers appear to be entering a **pre-decisional standoff**—testing thresholds, gauging reactions, and preparing escalation ladders. Expect significant intelligence signal distortion and potential for misattribution in coming 48–72 hours.

### Forecast

- **Gulf of Oman:** 65% chance of verified attack or mechanical mishap announcement within 24–48 hours.
- **Iran–Israel:** Continued limited missile and drone exchanges (90% confidence).
- **China:** 75% chance of increased U.S. or Japanese military flyovers in response to PLA Navy activity.
- **Markets:** Brent crude highly sensitive; expected +5–10% volatility if Hormuz incident confirmed.
