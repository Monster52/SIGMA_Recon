# ECHO Watch 2025-06-08

## Last 24 Hours

Over the last 24 hours, the **Iran–Israel** conflict has escalated dramatically following Israel’s second wave of Operation Rising Lion. Strikes targeted IRGC command and C2 nodes in Qom and Tehran, prompting Iran’s Supreme Leader to declare “the battle begins.” Iranian retaliation is now expected through asymmetric means, including cyberattacks and proxy mobilization. Israeli missile defense reserves are reportedly strained, with the U.S. deploying additional interceptors and fighter squadrons. Tehran is repositioning weapons to target U.S. assets across the Gulf, and signs point to potential mine activity near the Strait of Hormuz. Israeli cyber operations have disrupted Iranian banks, signaling a digital front in the confrontation.

In **Ukraine, Russia** launched a devastating combined missile and drone strike on Kyiv, killing at least 16—including a U.S. citizen—and injuring over 130. The barrage was one of the largest in weeks and underscores Moscow’s continued effort to degrade Ukraine’s energy grid and psychological stability ahead of the summer campaign window.

In the **Indo-Pacific**, Chinese military signaling intensified. Taiwan completed the maiden sea trial of its first indigenous submarine (Narwhal), a significant milestone in undersea deterrence. Simultaneously, PLA carrier groups conducted joint drills near Taiwan, while U.S. and Philippine forces launched live-fire coastal defense exercises in response. A high-profile civilian war game in Taipei exposed strategic and procedural weaknesses in Taiwan’s response to a simulated PLA invasion, raising concerns over coordination in a real crisis. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly called for de-escalation in the Middle East and initiated evacuations of Chinese nationals—highlighting Beijing's intent to avoid entanglement while preserving global standing.

**North Korea** remained quiet externally, but strategic watchers continue to flag ICBM transporter movements and new infrastructure at Yongbyon as potential indicators of a pending nuclear demonstration.

## Regional Breakdown

### Iran–Israel Conflict – 24-Hour Breakdown (As of 18 June 2025)

**Israeli Strikes and Target Selection**

Israel continued its multi-day air campaign under Operation Rising Lion, launching a second wave of precision strikes deep into Iranian territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed hits on IRGC communications facilities, signals intelligence stations, and residential compounds associated with senior nuclear program officials near Qom and Tehran. Unverified footage and satellite imagery suggest follow-up bomb damage assessment (BDA) flights occurred overnight.

These strikes indicate a clear doctrinal shift: from reactive containment to strategic decapitation. Israel is targeting not only infrastructure but the leadership architecture necessary for Iran’s retaliatory coordination.

**Iranian Response and Escalatory Rhetoric**

In Tehran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei publicly declared, “The battle begins.” This rhetoric reflects Iran’s transition from rhetorical deterrence to imminent retaliatory planning. Iranian media has warned of “surprises” and “historic responses,” with particular reference to cyber and proxy attacks.

Signals intelligence (SIGINT) reports suggest heightened readiness among IRGC-linked units in western Iran and mobilization patterns consistent with Shahed drone deployments. Iranian air defense posture has been elevated around key installations in Esfahan and Natanz.

**Cyber & Economic Domain**

In parallel with kinetic actions, cyber escalation is underway. Israeli-linked cyber operations reportedly disrupted several Iranian financial institutions, temporarily disabling transactional systems in multiple banks. Iranian cyber units—specifically the IRGC’s Shahid Kaveh group—are expected to respond, potentially targeting Israeli energy infrastructure or allied critical infrastructure (e.g., Gulf state desalination or aviation networks).

**U.S. Posture Shift – Force Movement and Deterrent Signaling**

The United States has substantially altered its military posture in the region in direct response to the risk of Iranian retaliation and potential strikes on U.S. facilities. Over the last 24 hours:

   - F-35, F-22, and F-16 squadrons were repositioned to forward bases in Al Udeid (Qatar), Al Dhafra (UAE), and Jordan.

   - The USS Nimitz and USS Truman Carrier Strike Groups were confirmed operating in the Eastern Mediterranean and Gulf of Oman, with Arleigh Burke–class destroyers forming an integrated ballistic missile defense (BMD) screen.

   - THAAD and Patriot batteries have been surged into UAE, Kuwait, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, forming a defensive umbrella for CENTCOM installations and Gulf partners.

   - ISR oper ations using RC-135 Rivet Joint and RQ-4 Global Hawk have intensified over suspected Iranian launch corridors and proxy-controlled areas in Iraq and Syria.

This U.S. deployment serves multiple strategic purposes:

   - Dissuade Iran from expanding its retaliatory envelope to include U.S. targets

   - Extend Israel’s operational freedom by covering regional second-order threats

   - Prepare for interceptive action if Iranian ballistic or drone strikes cross redlines, especially toward Gulf bases or Israeli territory

   - Project resolve while maintaining plausible deniability of direct combat entry

**Strategic Impact & Outlook**

The rapid and visible movement of U.S. forces dramatically raises the threshold for Iranian escalation. While Tehran may still pursue asymmetric responses (cyber, proxy attacks, drones), it is now deterred from launching large-scale direct strikes on Israeli or American soil without risking direct U.S. retaliation. However, the risk of inadvertent escalation or proxy overreach remains dangerously high.

Israel is likely to maintain its current tempo, with a potential third wave of strikes aimed at missile logistics and IRGC command bunkers. Meanwhile, Iran's calculus will center on crafting a retaliatory action severe enough to preserve deterrence—yet measured enough to avoid full-scale regional war.

### Russia-Ukraine

Russia executed one of its most extensive aerial attacks of the year, launching approximately **440 Shahed drones**, **32 cruise missiles**, and several ballistic munitions in a coordinated assault on Kyiv and surrounding regions. The barrage struck at least **27 sites**, including apartment blocks, educational facilities, and power infrastructure. The death toll has reached **23**, including a confirmed U.S. citizen, with over **130 civilians injured**. Emergency services reported multiple structural collapses in Solomianskyi District, while substations and critical communications hubs sustained major damage. 

This attack represents an evolution in Russia’s saturation doctrine, blending low-cost drone waves with precision cruise missile salvos to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses and maximize psychological and infrastructural disruption. It appears designed not to gain immediate battlefield advantage, but to degrade Ukraine’s civilian resilience, undermine energy stability, and provoke strategic exhaustion within NATO’s support pipeline.

In response, Ukrainian air defenses—though strained—successfully intercepted a majority of incoming munitions. However, the intensity of the attack is stretching Ukraine’s integrated air defense network and forcing real-time triage decisions. Ukrainian counterstrikes reportedly targeted fuel depots and staging areas in Russian-occupied Luhansk and possibly Belgorod, signaling Kyiv’s continued capacity for retaliatory precision, even under heavy pressure.

International response has been swift. The **U.S. State Department** condemned the strikes and confirmed the American casualty, reinforcing its support for Ukraine. **Canada** announced a $1.4 billion support package, while the **UK** levied new sanctions on Russian arms producers and energy exporters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared a national day of mourning and called for enhanced Western contributions to missile defense and intelligence-sharing. 

Strategically, this attack underscores Russia’s intent to escalate horizontally—attacking the will and infrastructure of Ukraine’s population while avoiding direct NATO engagement. The integration of high-volume drone warfare and precise missile coordination reflects Russia’s refinement of hybrid attritional strategy. If this pattern continues, Ukraine’s defensive posture may require accelerated resupply and reconfiguration to avoid further degradation. The presence of a U.S. casualty could serve as a diplomatic turning point, subtly increasing the pressure on Washington to escalate material or intelligence support.

### China-Taiwan

Over the past day, Taiwan marked a significant stride in its asymmetric defense capabilities with the 
**maiden sea trial of its first domestically produced submarine, the “Narwhal”** (*Hai Kun*). Built by 
CSBC and integrating a U.S. combat system along with Mark 48 torpedoes, the trial validated vital 
systems including propulsion, ventilation, and radar—though submerged testing remains pending. 
The Narwhal represents a T$49.36 billion (~$1.67 billion) investment and underscores Taiwan's 
determination to enhance undersea deterrence amid increasing Chinese naval pressure.

Simultaneously, a **civilian-led war game** in Taipei simulated a PLA invasion scenario set in 2030. 
Involving former U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese officials, the tabletop exercise highlighted procedural 
gaps and early overreactions among Taiwanese participants. The U.S. team notably assumed automatic 
military support for Taiwan—spotlighting unclear escalation thresholds and exposing vulnerability 
in current command-and-coordination frameworks.

On the Chinese side, **two PLA carrier strike groups** (likely the *Liaoning* and *Shandong*) continued 
operations in the Western Pacific—conducting presence missions east of Luzon and demonstrating 
increased capability projection beyond the First Island Chain. These naval maneuvers appear timed 
to coincide with Taiwan’s domestic advancements, testing deterrence thresholds and alliance 
responsiveness in real time.

**Significance:**  
Taiwan's submarine trial signals a credible leap forward in maritime defense posture, strengthening 
both undersea warfare and blockade deterrence. Yet, the simulated war game reveals ongoing 
weaknesses in alliance cohesion and crisis decision-making—critical in real-world contingency. 
Meanwhile, PLA carrier activity underscores China’s intent to normalize far-seas naval power 
projection while probing U.S. and regional readiness. This synchronization of Taiwanese defense 
modernization with Chinese signaling actions suggests rising risk of miscalculation. Redline 
awareness—particularly around U.S. assumptions of intervention—remains paramount in the current 
posture cycle.
