      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for ‚Äúregime change in Russia‚Äù on the morning of August 1, following Russia‚Äôs devastating overnight missile and drone strike on Kyiv that killed at least 26 civilians, including three children. U.S. President Donald Trump responded publicly, labeling the Russian assault as ‚Äúdisgusting.‚Äù The strike, one of the deadliest of the year, targeted residential infrastructure and marked a significant psychological and humanitarian escalation.

In a concurrent development, President Trump used the UN Security Council on July 31 to declare his intent to secure a ceasefire deal in Ukraine by August 8. He warned that failure to reach progress would trigger a new wave of U.S. tariffs and sanctions on Russia. The timeline sets a narrow diplomatic fuse and re-centers American pressure through multilateral channels.

In the Indo-Pacific, Chinese internal assessments have raised the estimated probability of a Taiwan invasion from 5% to 7% over the next 6‚Äì12 months. This follows ‚ÄúStrait Thunder 2025A‚Äù PLA exercises, which featured aggressive military posturing and dehumanizing rhetoric targeting Taiwan‚Äôs leadership. The increase reflects a calibrated shift in the PLA‚Äôs threat messaging strategy, aiming to sustain pressure without crossing kinetic thresholds.

No double-source-confirmed operational activity has been reported in the North Korea or Israel‚ÄìIran theaters over the last 12 hours.
