      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>Russia launched a massive overnight assault on July 30â€“31, deploying approximately 309 Shahed-type attack drones and 8 Iskander-K cruise missiles. The primary target was Kyiv, though strikes were also reported in Dnipro, Poltava, Sumy, and Mykolaiv.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 288 drones and 3 missiles, but 5 missiles and 21 drones evaded defenses. One missile struck a nine-story residential block in Kyivâ€™s Sviatoshynskyi district, causing a major collapse. Casualties currently stand at 6 killed (including a 6-year-old boy) and 52 wounded, with rescue operations ongoing. At least 27 locations across Kyiv sustained impact or debris damage.

A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck Russiaâ€™s Kamchatka Peninsula, impacting the area near Vilyuchinsk Naval Baseâ€”home to Russiaâ€™s Pacific Borei- and Yasen-class strategic submarines. There is no official word from the Kremlin on damage to the facility, but civilian infrastructure in the region sustained visible effects. The potential compromise of nuclear submarine operations introduces a rare, environment-induced variable into deterrence posture.

In the Indo-Pacific, no major PLA incursions were recorded near Taiwan in the past 24 hours. Taiwanâ€™s MOD logged only routine ADIZ violations, while the Chinese MFA continued aggressive public messaging. U.S.â€“Taiwan defense posture remains steady but cautious.

      <h4>What to Watch For</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Russia: Follow-on strikes or escalation into high-value military targets; watch for evidence of ISR degradation or preparation for ground thrusts</li>
        <li> Vilyuchinsk Base: Satellite imagery, AIS data, or indirect indicators of port infrastructure disruption</li>
        <li> Chinaâ€“Taiwan: Shifts in PLA naval groupings or multi-domain coordination drills</li>
        <li> Global Signaling: Cross-theater timingâ€”watch for paired movements from Iran, North Korea, or Russia in alternate regions</li>
