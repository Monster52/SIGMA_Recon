      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>The Red Sea crisis re-escalated as Houthi militants attacked and sank two commercial vesselsâ€”the Eternity C and Magic Seasâ€”triggering fatalities and global concern over shipping security. Overnight, Russia executed a high-volume aerial strike on multiple Ukrainian cities, with Kyiv and Mykolaiv among the hardest hit. Despite most intercepts, casualties and infrastructure losses were confirmed. In parallel, a Ukrainian domestic intelligence officer was assassinated in central Kyiv, pointing toward a resurgence in hybrid warfare tactics likely coordinated by Russian operatives.</p>
