      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>President Trump has sharply reversed course on Ukraine, delivering Patriot missile systems and threatening full-spectrum economic warfare unless Russia agrees to a peace deal within 50 days. The ultimatum includes a plan to implement 100% tariffs and severe secondary sanctions targeting Russian exports and international trade routes. Moscow dismissed the warning as ‚Äútheatrical,‚Äù but internal Russian messaging has reportedly shifted toward contingency planning.

      Meanwhile, intelligence now confirms that Israeli airstrikes during the June Iran-Israel war wounded Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The strike targeted a bunker hosting a high-level Iranian leadership meeting in Tehran. Six precision-guided missiles struck structural choke points, leading officials to suspect a major intelligence leak. Tehran has vowed retaliation, raising the specter of asymmetric escalation.

      On the eastern flank, South Korean intelligence reports that North Korea has supplied Russia with over 12 million artillery shells and at least 13,000 troops and engineers, some of whom have operated in frontline combat zones. Russia praised the support as part of an ‚Äúinvincible fighting brotherhood.‚Äù The volume and scale of North Korea‚Äôs contributions suggest a structural extension of the Ukraine war into Asia-Pacific strategic alliances.</p>

      <h4>What to Watch For</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> - Kremlin response to President Trump‚Äôs 50-day ultimatum: diplomatic probes, reserve call-ups, or internal posture changes  </li>
        <li> - Iranian retaliation planning: cyber strikes, regional proxy activation, or covert Israeli targeting  </li>
        <li> - U.S. enforcement mechanisms for new sanctions, including maritime interdiction or financial blacklisting   </li>
        <li> - Potential surge in Israeli-Iranian covert operations following exposure of bunker strike</li>
