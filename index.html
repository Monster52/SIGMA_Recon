      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>Russia launched a large-scale overnight missile and drone barrage against Kyiv on July 31, marking the deadliest strike on the capital in 2025. Early reports confirm between 14 and 31 fatalities, including a 6-year-old boy, with over 100 wounded. The attack caused widespread destruction across multiple residential areas, with at least dozens of impact zones identified. Ukrainian air defense response details remain limited at this time. The strikeâ€™s intensity, timing, and civilian toll suggest deliberate psychological escalationâ€”possibly linked to shifts in Ukrainian political posture or symbolic timing.

In the Indo-Pacific, 11 PLA aircraft (10 crossing the Taiwan Strait median line) and 6 PLAN naval vessels were detected around Taiwanâ€™s ADIZ. No kinetic actions occurred. This activity fits a persistent Chinese pattern of gray-zone aerial pressure and maritime signaling without exceeding engagement thresholds. Taiwanâ€™s Ministry of National Defence released the standard flight and naval activity data.

In the Red Sea, Iran-backed Houthi forces publicly threatened to attack any vessels with Israeli commercial links, declaring an intent to expand target selection. No confirmed missile or drone attacks were reported in the last 12 hours. This rhetorical escalationâ€”absent kinetic follow-throughâ€”may precede a renewed strike phase or act as a deterrent maneuver under Iranian coordination.

No significant or double-source-confirmed strategic activity was reported from North Korea in the past 12 hours.

      <h4>What to Watch For</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Russia: Follow-on strikes on command-and-control or power infrastructure; evidence of decoy drone saturation or cruise missile massing</li>
        <li> Kyiv Impact Zones: Satellite imagery of collapsed residential structures, displaced civilian movement, or emergency logistical bottlenecks</li>
        <li> Chinaâ€“Taiwan: Deviation from routine ADIZ patterning (e.g., EW platforms, H-6K bombers); surface group coordination with amphibious units</li>
        <li> Houthis: Renewed missile or drone launches targeting tankers, container vessels, or foreign-flagged assets transiting Bab el-Mandeb</li>
        <li> Cross-Theater Linkage: Potential synchronized messaging or action across Red Seaâ€“Ukraineâ€“Korea axis to exploit attention divergence</li>
