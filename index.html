      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>Ukraine has escalated the drone war, launching what appears to be its largest UAV strike on Russian territory to date. Russian officials report intercepting at least 126 drones overnight, with damage reported in several oblasts and temporary flight shutdowns around Moscow. This marks a bold expansion of Ukraineâ€™s asymmetric strike doctrine deep into Russian airspace.

      In the Middle East, Israeli air defense systems successfully intercepted a Houthi-launched ballistic missile, a significant step-up from drone activity. Warning sirens were activated in southern Israel near the Dead Sea, though no casualties were reported. The use of a ballistic missile indicates a more advanced Houthi arsenal, likely with Iranian support.

      Meanwhile, China intensified its military presence around Taiwan. Taiwanâ€™s Ministry of National Defense reported 58 PLA aircraft and 9 PLAN vessels operating around the island. The maneuvers coincide with Taiwanâ€™s ongoing Han Kuang national defense drills, which have now shifted to extended defensive operations. The PLAâ€™s activity appears designed to stress-test Taiwanâ€™s readiness and signal continued escalation pressure in the Strait.</p>

      <h4>What to Watch For</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> - Russian retaliation following mass Ukrainian drone strike, possibly via long-range missile strikes or cyber disruption</li>
        <li> - Evidence of Iranian assistance in Houthi ballistic missile capabilities; potential Israeli retaliation in Yemen or Syria</li>
        <li> - PLA amphibious rehearsal patterns or political signaling during final phases of Han Kuang exercise</li>
