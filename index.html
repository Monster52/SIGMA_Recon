      <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
      <p>Russia escalated its campaign with a high-volume strike targeting Ukraineâ€™s western citiesâ€”Lviv, Lutsk, and Chernivtsiâ€”killing at least two civilians and damaging residential, administrative, and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian and regional officials confirmed extensive fires and power outages, underscoring the growing reach of Russiaâ€™s long-range assets.

      Israeli air defenses intercepted several Houthi drones launched from Yemen. While no casualties were reported in Israel, falling debris once again sparked a fire in Jordanian territory, highlighting the regional risk of spillover from Houthi attacks.

      In response, Israel conducted a new wave of airstrikes on Houthi infrastructure in Yemen, targeting weapons storage, port facilities, and power stations used for UAV operations. The strikes are part of a broader effort to degrade Houthi capabilities and deter further attacks on Israeli territory.

      The last 12 hours reflect a pattern of intensifying cross-regional entanglement, with major powers and non-state actors escalating military activity from Eastern Europe to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

      <h4>What to Watch For</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>- Russian use of deep-strike assets and expanded targeting beyond Donbas frontlines  </li>
        <li>- Houthi retaliation cycle and potential for additional drone or missile launches at Israel or Red Sea shipping  </li>
        <li>- Israeli escalation options, including strikes on Yemen-based command, control, and logistics hubs  </li>
        <li>- Jordanian diplomatic and military response to recurring cross-border debris incidents  </li>
        <li>- Shifts in regional air defense readiness posture (Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt)</li>
